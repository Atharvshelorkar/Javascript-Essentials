        <ul>
            <li>The Number Data Type</li>
            <p>The number data type is used to represent positive or negative numbers with or without decimal place, or numbers written using exponential notation</p>
            
            <li>The Boolean Data Type</li>
            <p>The Boolean data type can hold only two values: true or false. It is typically used to store values like yes (true) or no (false), on (true) or off (false)</p>
            
            <li>The Undefined Data Type</li>
            <p>The undefined data type can only have one value-the special value undefined. If a variable has been declared, but has not been assigned a value, has the value undefined.</p>
            
            <li>The Null Data Type</li>
            <p>This is another special data type that can have only one value-the null value. A null value means that there is no value. It is not equivalent to an empty string ("") or 0, it is simply nothing.
               A variable can be explicitly emptied of its current contents by assigning it the null value.</p>

            <li>The Object Data Type</li>
            <p>The object is a complex data type that allows you to store collections of data.
                An object contains properties, defined as a key-value pair. A property key (name) is always a string, but the value can be any data type, like strings, numbers, booleans, or complex data types like arrays, function and other objects. You'll learn more about objects in upcoming chapters.
                The following example will show you the simplest way to create an object in JavaScript.</p>

            <li>The Array Data Type</li>
            <p>An array is a type of object used for storing multiple values in single variable. Each value (also called an element) in an array has a numeric position, known as its index, and it may contain data of any data type-numbers, strings, booleans, functions, objects, and even other arrays.</p>

            <li>The Function Data Type</li>
            <p>The function is callable object that executes a block of code. Since functions are objects, so it is possible to assign them to variables</p>

            <li>The typeof Operator</li>
            <p>he typeof operator can be used to find out what type of data a variable or operand contains. It can be used with or without parentheses (typeof(x) or typeof x).</p>
